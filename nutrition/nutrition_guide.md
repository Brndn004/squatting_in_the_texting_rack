# Nutrition Guide for Muscle Building

## Caloric Requirements

Based on your stats (31 years, 5'9", 145 lbs) and high-volume training approach:

- **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)**: ~1,600 calories
- **Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)**: ~3,000-3,200 calories (with intense 2x/day training)
- **Aggressive Surplus Goal**: 1,000-2,800 calories above TDEE
- **Target Daily Calories**: 4,000-6,000 calories (progressive increase)

## Macronutrient Breakdown

### Protein: 180-220g daily (1.2-1.5g per pound of bodyweight)
- **Why**: Essential for muscle repair and growth with high training volume
- **Percentage of Diet**: ~20-25% of total calories (lower percentage due to higher overall intake)
- **Timing**: 30-40g every 3-4 hours, with emphasis on pre/post-workout windows

### Carbohydrates: 500-650g daily (scaling up to 700-800g)
- **Why**: Primary fuel source for intense 2x/day training sessions
- **Percentage of Diet**: ~55-60% of total calories
- **Timing**: Higher intake before/after workouts, moderate throughout day

### Fats: 110-150g daily
- **Why**: Hormonal regulation, caloric density, nutrient absorption
- **Percentage of Diet**: ~20-25% of total calories
- **Timing**: Moderate intake throughout day, lower around workout times

## Meal Frequency and Timing for 2-a-Day Training

- **Optimal Frequency**: 6-8 meals/snacks per day
- **Morning Pre-Workout**: 1-2 hours before - 40g protein, 80-100g carbs, 15g fat
- **Morning Post-Workout**: Within 30 minutes - 40g protein, 80g carbs, minimal fat
- **Mid-Day Meal**: Complete meal with balanced macros
- **Evening Pre-Workout**: 1 hour before - 30g protein, 60g carbs, minimal fat
- **Evening Post-Workout**: Within 30 minutes - 40g protein, 60g carbs, minimal fat
- **Bedtime Nutrition**: Slow-digesting protein + fats to support overnight recovery

## Strategic Nutrition for Optimal Recovery Between 2-a-Day Sessions

- **Anti-inflammatory foods**: Berries, fatty fish, turmeric, ginger
- **Antioxidant-rich foods**: Colorful fruits and vegetables
- **Electrolytes**: Sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium

### Post-2-a-Day Recovery Strategy
- **Evening**: Emphasize complete protein sources and complex carbs
- **Next Morning**: Focus on anti-inflammatory foods and antioxidants
- **Throughout Recovery Day**: Higher healthy fat intake, moderate carbs

## Weekly Meal Prep Strategy for High-Volume Eating

1. **Bulk Cooking (1-2x weekly)**:
   - Cook 5-10 lbs of various meats (chicken, beef, fish)
   - Prepare 10+ cups of rice, pasta, potatoes
   - Roast large batches of vegetables
   - Pre-portion nuts, seeds, and trail mix

2. **Shake Preparation**:
   - Pre-measure protein, mass gainer ingredients in containers
   - Freeze fruit portions for quick shake assembly

3. **Strategic Quick-Access Foods**:
   - Hard-boiled eggs (dozen+ at a time)
   - Pre-made sandwiches and wraps
   - Yogurt parfaits
   - Overnight oats

4. **Tracking and Adjustment**:
   - Record daily intake via tracking app
   - Weekly weigh-ins (same day/time)
   - Adjust calories up by 300-500 if weight gain stalls
   - Measurement tracking bi-weekly
