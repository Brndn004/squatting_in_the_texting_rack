# Nutrition Database Project TODO

- [x] USDA database lookup and validation mechanism
- [x] Update usda_lookup.py to save ingredients as `<FDC_ID>.json` (remove name from filename)
- [x] Create reverse-lookup database for ingredient-name-to-FDC-ID mapping
- [x] Script to convert human-readable measures (cups, tablespoons, etc.) to USDA foodPortions units using USDA foodPortions data
- [x] Script to calculate and update recipe nutrition facts from ingredients (recomputes all recipes based on current ingredient data, includes all nutrients from all ingredients)
- [ ] Script to generate simple nutrition facts label for each recipe
- [ ] Script/functionality to filter recipes by tags
