# Meal Philosophy

## Goals

* Each meal is exactly 500 calories.
* Each meal is made up of USDA foundational ingredients so we can use the USDA database for nutrition information.
* There are multiple types of meals:
    * Carb-forward.
    * Protein-forward.
    * Fat-forward.
* Each meal has a nutrition facts label / database entry so that tracking is easier.
    * This will also make it easier to introduce other meals, e.g. eating out every now and then.
* This is focused entirely on me personally.
    * If it works well, then I can later try to genericize it, but there's no reason to genericize it today.
