2. Pull ribs toward pelvis, focusing on abdominal contraction
3. Hold briefly at point of maximum contraction
4. Return to starting position with control

**Key Points:**
- Movement should come from waist, not arms
- Keep hips stationary throughout
- Focus on curling spine rather than just bending at hips
- Maintain tension throughout the movement

### 9. Ab Wheel Rollouts

**Setup:**
1. Kneel on a mat with ab wheel on floor in front of you
2. Grasp handles of ab wheel with both hands
3. Arms extended, shoulders stacked over wheel
4. Core engaged, back flat

**Execution:**
1. Slowly roll the wheel forward, extending your body
2. Keep core tight to prevent lower back arching
3. Roll out as far as you can while maintaining form
4. Use abs to pull the wheel back to starting position

**Key Points:**
- Control the movement in both directions
- Only roll out as far as you can maintain neutral spine
- For easier version, limit range of motion
- For advanced version, start from standing position
