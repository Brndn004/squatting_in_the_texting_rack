# How to work out

## Major points

1. Tension is king.
2. ~2 second negatives, especially on your final reps.
3. Explosive positives.
4. Use a full range of motion, at least focus on the stretch while lifting.
5. Minimize momentum.
6. Be 2-3 reps shy of failure until the final set, which you should do to failure.
7. Progressive overload.
8. Choose high-tension exercises.
9. Rest for at least one minute between sets.
10. 10-20 sets per body part per week.
11. Switch exercise selections and/or rep schemes between every 2-5 months.

* Applies mostly to hypertrophy training.
* Goal is to increase stimulus-to-fatigue ratio.
    * Stimulus: tension applied to the muscle.
